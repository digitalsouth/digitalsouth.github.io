        Welcome to our Featured Projects page! This collection span humanities and social science departments through UNC while maintaining a focus in the American South while utilizing digital methods to carry their pedagogical or research goals. These methodologies
        range from GIS mapping to podcasting to text analysis, resulting in an intellectually rich array of projects.

        Further, we have chosen to focus on projects that have been created in approximately the last 5 years with most being from the year or two. What this has let us discover is that Carolina is rich with digital pedagogy initiatives that allow students of
        all standing, faculty, and staff to collaborate with one another. These projects aren’t only focused on the classroom, as others originate from the scholars’ venture into special collections, digitized newspapers, and beyond. </p>
