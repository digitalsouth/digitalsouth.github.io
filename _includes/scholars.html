        ABOUT THE FEATURED SCHOLARS
    </H3>
    <p class='flow-text light'>
        This page is a directory for current UNC scholars researching the American South utilizing various digital methodologies. Scholars come from a myriad of departments across campus and have different approaches and questions, but ultimately they are all
        interested in advancing our understanding of the South through digital methods.
