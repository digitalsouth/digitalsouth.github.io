Director of the Southern Oral History Program, Kotch conducts research in modern American history (especially the social history of criminal justice). His book, Lethal State (2019), explores the history of the death penalty in North Carolina from its colonial origins. His digital projects include “A Red Record,” a student-driven project exploring lynching and its victims in the American South.
