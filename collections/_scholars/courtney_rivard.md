Her interdisciplinary work combines Composition and Rhetoric, digital humanities and feminist studies to look at the rhetoric of history in the space of archives. Her first book, Voice of a Nation: Mapping Documentary Expression in New Deal America, combines archival and quantitative methods to uncover the history of the Southern Life Histories Project, part of the Federal Writers’ Project during the 1930s (forthcoming in 2022 with Stanford University Press). This innovative digital book demonstrates how gender and race informed the writing practices used to create the concept of “life histories,” which documented the lives of Southerners struggling to survive the Great Depression.
