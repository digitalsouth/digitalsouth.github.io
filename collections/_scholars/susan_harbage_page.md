Susan Harbage Page has spent her life crossing borders, both literally and figuratively. She's an artist and social justice activist. The major corpus of Harbage Pageâ€™s work has unfolded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Project (2007-present), on a three-fold development which illuminates a history of continuing trauma caused by bordering practices in the Rio Grande Valley. The focus on archives asks the viewer to consider how they shape our histories, whose narratives get included, and whose narratives get left out or abandoned.
