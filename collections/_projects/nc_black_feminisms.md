North Carolina Black Feminisms is a project led by Dr. Antonia Randolph in her AMST 089. Students in this class choose a notable Black women from North Carolina and create a short biograph of their lives and historical legacy. These biographies are then compiled together into the project's StoryMap's website, which maps the local of these important figures alongside providing visual components to the biographies. 

The goal is to continue adding more figures to this website through future iterations of the class in hopes of sharing the vital legacies these women have left in North Carolina.
