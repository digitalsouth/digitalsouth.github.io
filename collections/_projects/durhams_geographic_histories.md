description: "Dr. Martin's GEO429, 'Urban Political Geography of Durham, NC,' (an APPLES course) has students learn about structural and social problems by analyzing the complex city of Durham, NC. Students learn about Durham's history by utilizing historical North Carolina data and by consulting historical maps of Durham, located in Wilson Library's North Carolina Collection. Students research a particular section of history and communicate their findings through digital humanities projects. In the latest iteration (2021) of the course, students developed podcasts, allowing them to learn to use audio editing software and recording equipment alongside storytelling and interviewing techniques. In 2020, students created ArcGIS StoryMaps to communicate their research and experiential learning experiences."
