The Descendants Project is a research collaboration between Dr. Glenn Hinson, his students, local chapters of the NAACP, and the Equal Justice Initiative. The project aims to uncover the complete stories of victims of lynchings, their legacies, and their descendants, in order to advocate for public memorialization of those victims. Tracing family histories through digital resources such as ancestry.com alongside digitized censuses, obituaries, birth records, and other available documents, students in Dr. Hinson’s class learn to conduct digital historical research that has an impact on the present day. Their research leads them into local communities to conduct interviews with the descendants of those who were victims of lynching; the interviews are preserved in UNC’s Wilson Library as an oral history archive.
Beyond the ultimate aim of this project to create public memorials for the victims of lynchings in their respective communities, project goals include the development of curricula for schools focused on local histories, and the creation of a website to make the project more publicly accessible.
