On These Grounds: Slavery and the University is a cross institution project that aims to examine the ways in which higher education insitutions are intertwined with the legacy of slavery. Part of this investigation involves examinining the recorded and lived experiences of enslaved individuals through archival records. The team at Carolina: Chaitra Powell, Anna Goslen, Laura Hart, and Dr. James E. Leloudis will utilize Wilson Library's special collection material to center the narratives of enslaved individuals in these documents.
