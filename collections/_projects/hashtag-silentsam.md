In 2016, the confederate monument nicknamed “Silent Sam” that was located on the campus of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC), was beginning to attract attention on Twitter with the hashtag #SilentSam. The social media data group at UNC created a series of visualizations that would continually update and allow an interactive, real-time experience of the conversation surrounding the controversy.
