In 2018, during the height of the protest to remove UNC's Confederate monument, Silent Sam, Dr. Leloudis, Professor of History, and Dr. Moore, University Historian, created Silent Sam Online to help people learn about UNC's history of that monument and Confederate memorialization more broadly. Teaching this history of the University and nation is an initial step towards a future that addresses and prevents these injustices to continue.
